libsnark-zk-AuthFeed: zk-AuthFeed circuits construction
================================================================================

### This code is the prototype implementation of the paper titled **zk-AuthFeed: Protecting Data Feed to Smart Contracts with Authenticated Zero Knowledge Proof**.

### The zk-AuthFeed extends the normal zk-SNARK circuit with a hash sub-circuit, aiming to achieve authenticity as well as privacy. 

### zk-AuthFeed can be thought of as *the trusted zk-SNARK* to some extent.
